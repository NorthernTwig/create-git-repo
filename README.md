If you don't want to be prompted for password all the time, create an access token on github
with the right to create repositories
and export it as an enviroment variable aswell as your github username.

```sh
# In .bashrc or equivalent
export GITHUB_USERNAME="xxxxxxx"
export GITHUB_CREATE_REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxx
